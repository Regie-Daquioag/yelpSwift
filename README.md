# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp Search App** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [ x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [ x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. More on what constaints I should put on what view/label/outlet
2. I would also like to know how to make the search bar work because it only told us to have the search bar in the navigation view controller.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges that I had was trying to make sure that the labels were not going over each other. I also had trouble making the app fill  up the whole screen when I rotated it.
